Evidence clearly shows that success is highly contextual and stakeholder-dependent: success might be financial, social, physical and even emotional, suggesting that software engineering success is a multifaceted variable that cannot explained simply by user satisfaction, profitability or meeting requirements, budgets and schedules.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Whereas [external correctness criteria] are concerned with how software behaves technically according to specifications, some qualities concern properties of how developers interact with code:<sup id="fnref:2:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p><ul><li><strong>Verifiability</strong> is the effort required to verify that software does what it is intended to do. For example, it is hard to verify a safety critical system without either proving it correct or testing it in a safety-critical context (which isn’t safe). Take driverless cars, for example: for Google to test their software, they’ve had to set up thousands of paid drivers to monitor and report problems on the road. In contrast, verifying that a simple static HTML web page works correctly is as simple as opening it in a browser.<li><strong>Maintainability</strong> is the effort required to correct, adapt, or perfect software. This depends mostly on how comprehensible and modular an implementation is.<li><strong>Reusability</strong> is the effort required to use a program’s components for purposes other than those for which it was originally designed. APIs are reusable by definition, whereas black box embedded software (like the software built into a car’s traction systems) is not.</ul></blockquote><p>Together, we call these criteria for how developers interact with code, “internal correctness.”</p><dl><dt>Internal correctness<dd>A program where the desired outcome is easily understood by other human programmers.</dl><p>Writing high-quality programs takes deliberate practice, so these guidelines are not meant to be memorized at first. Instead, we’ll learn how to write high-quality programs through a process called <strong>code review</strong>, the practice of reviewing code with an eye towards code quality.</p><h3 id="documenting-code"> <a href="#documenting-code" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Documenting code</h3><p>The goal of documenting code is to describe what happens without going into detail about how.</p><p>For example, say we added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nextDay</code> method to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CalendarDate</code> class that returns a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CalendarDate</code> for the following day. In order to work as expected, the implementation of the method might increment the month if the current day is already the last day of the month (which varies across different months). Or, it might increment the year if the current date is New Year’s Eve.</p><p>But these <strong>implementation details</strong> aren’t relevant to the <strong>client</strong> of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CalendarDate</code> class. We document code by adding inline code comments. Ideally, a client should only have to read the method comment (a line preceded by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">//</code>) and the method signature (return type, name, parameters) to know how to use a method.</p><div overlay="Implementer" class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">CalendarDate</span> <span class="o">{</span>
